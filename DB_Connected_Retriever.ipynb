        "Task Description:\n",
        "You will be given the output of `tflint`, a Terraform linter, and a corresponding Terraform script. Your task is to interpret this output, identify issues flagged by the linter, and apply corrections to the Terraform script accordingly. Follow these steps to ensure accuracy and compliance with Terraform standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps to Follow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Review `tflint` Output:\n",
        "   - Start by examining the `tflint` output provided. It will detail specific issues including the type of issue, its severity, and the exact location within the Terraform script (file and line number).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Analyze Each Issue:\n",
        "   - For every issue listed by `tflint`, evaluate the context and the code surrounding the flagged location to understand why it was marked. This includes syntax errors, deprecated elements, and best practice deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Apply Corrections:\n",
        "   - Direct Corrections: Adjust the script to resolve straightforward issues such as syntax errors or incorrect attribute names according to Terraform’s documentation.\n",
        "   - Best Practices: Update the script to replace hard-coded values with variables, add missing descriptions, or improve resource configurations as recommended by `tflint`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Document Changes:\n",
        "   - Add comments within the script next to each change. Briefly describe why the change was made to help with future maintenance and understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Validation:\n",
        "   - After implementing the changes, check the overall script to ensure that it still aligns with Terraform's syntax and best practices and that no new issues have been introduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Output the Revised Script:\n",
        "   - Provide the corrected Terraform script, highlighting the changes made. Also, include a summary of each correction addressing the specific issues identified by `tflint`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objective:\n",
        "The goal is to enhance the quality and compliance of the Terraform script based on the `tflint` feedback, making precise corrections without altering the script’s fundamental functionality or intent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please provide the output in a JSON format with two keys: 'corrected_terraform_code' and 'linting_summary'. The 'corrected_terraform_code' key should contain the formatted Terraform code enclosed in triple backticks for better readability. The 'linting_summary' should provide a markdown-formatted summary of the changes made, including headers and bullet points to outline corrections and important notes. Each key's content should be clear and easy to follow, making it straightforward for developers to understand the corrections and their implications on the code.\n",
