# Automatic Labelling from Localhost

This example demonstrates how to use the
[root module][root-module] and the
[event-project-log-entry submodule][event-project-log-entry-submodule]
to configure a system
which responds to Compute VM creation events by labelling them with the
principal email address of the account responsible for causing the events.

## Usage

To provision this example, populate `terraform.tfvars` with the [required variables](#inputs) and run the following commands within
this directory:

- `terraform init` to initialize the directory
- `terraform plan` to generate the execution plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the execution plan
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the infrastructure
